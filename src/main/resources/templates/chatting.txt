u have confuse me .i will see d mistakes dont worry
select table you want and press

all i did is wrong
does it work right?
its show me sub category of id 1

but i dont know how to know if im correct or not
so, I suppose you needed to have products from the same region as customer
yes
so?
check if its correct
your sql?
no from table if its correct
i don't get it... check result of your sql?
i want to know from the tables if its correct
how do i know if its corretct
oh man.. I said twise should I check result of your sql.. you are telling me about table..
I need to check result of your sql and data from table, right?
yes
if ohits thesame region n store ofdist
hmmmmmm)))
looks good man, but let me check it))
Alex in region (id = 3)
Distributors with id = 2 and id = 3 are have their stores in the same region where alex is
These products can see Alex, I think
yes
so?
so its correct right?
I can see only 2 of them
i said in suncat 1
aaa
let's check
yeap! it's right
u see i learn fast .but now can i make example if its not in the same region so that no product will show .
so lets fill product table
do you wanna see product from another region, not as alex is from?
i know how that is done.i mean i dont wanna see product where alex is from.make an example
I don't get it... I am saying what you want, but you sau, enother... I don't und u
u see our out put is 2 right cos alex is in the region where the distributor has stor right?
yes
 now let make and example where alex is not in the region where the distributor has store
 put alex in another region
 or product in diff dist_id
it's silly, if you put alex in another region, you need to correct only one value)
it's better)
ok let me see
man, you don't remember, thar that distr were from 2 and 3?????????
oh dear,
what do you mean?
mean?
why did you remove it?
its name not product name
man, are you silly?
p is product?
yes
so p.name is product_name!
you are still confusing all
sub_category has name field!
don't be silly, opls
it's right
do you know why?
cos alex is in diff region?
Alex is from Kursk, right?
yes
so lets see where distr have their stores
all three dists have their stores in kursk
und?
wait
yes
so we don't need to join....wait..thinking
wait))) let me think)
aaaaa
everything is right!!! alex is form 3 region!!!!
und?
no i changed it to 1
are you kiddding?
u changed it back
what are you doing?
so?
what did u do
hahahaha))))
don't you und?))
oh man... you needed to get products from another region, not where custer is
hahahah.i didnt ask for that but its ok.
i dont wanna get product.i want a null table cos he is not from that region.but u did the opposite.wha
t u did is not needed for my site.c
os i dont need to show this.i need to show empty cos he is not from there
I showed you twice null table! but you din't stop me..wait
I did it twiscees
yseos
so?
why do u first select from store
cosa I switch on my brain!
I know, that I need prouduct ... but product doesn't have region_id
but store has it
so I need to select from store
then I need join it to distr, cose store has no idea about products it stores
so product has dist_id
it's easy
wait let me ask few question. ok
ok
so if i want to select product s
i must g to the store first and see if the region where customer is in the store right?
if you need to select product and watch it region, so you need to go to store at first
and do what?
see if the region where customer is in the storee>?
no of course
don't mix it, pls
you need to get products right?
yes
you need to know its' region right?
yes
so you need to go to store, cose store has region_id...
so you join store and distr, cos product doens' have store_id
product has distr_id, and store has it, so you need to join 3 tables: store, distr, product
so you selected aaaaalllll products..
then
you have a searching criteria, it's a region
so you have to search customer who live in the same (or not the same) region, so you need to join that 3 tables
with customer table, cosa you have already had region_id in store table, and you have region_id in customer table
und?
mmmmm i already understand before but r confusing me again.
why?
wait.first i go to store right
why do you go there?
cos i need to know which dist id the product has
no!!!
man, you are not understatnig me
the main goal is getting products, right?
you have main goal of getting prouds
so you need to select it from products table right?
yes
but you have one very important criteria.. this is a region, right?
yes
do you have region in products table?
no
wher do you hacve region_id witch connected to products?
store
great!!!
so you
select * from store
then... you have region_id and distr_id there, right?
yes
but you need to get products, right?
yes
how can you connect to store from products?
yes
not fucken yes! i said HOW???
dist id
so you are joining store + distributor + product
right?
yes
ok, what do you have after this conjuction?
blin
thnk
ok, let me explain you if you can't und this
if you join all these three tables (sotre + distributor + product), so you have
products which have distributors in shops which are located in regions
right?
yes
I have PRODUCTS!!!
it was my MAIN GOAL, don't yund?
yesi und
excellent!
so I have products with region, right/
it is agter joingin, don't you und?
yes i have region
you have PRODUCTS with info about its region
not region!!! MAIN GOAL IS PRODUCTS!!!!!!
und?
yes
oh dear.....
so, you have prod and region ... but you need also to constraint it, right?
yes
criteria is customer region, right?
yes
excellent
so customer has region in it's table?
yes
so just join customer with (store + distributor + product))
can you?
yes
so, is it hard?
not really
thats why I started from store, cose store has a region
you can start from products
thereis no matter
good
thats what i wanna hear
but!
It's better to me start from store, cosa it has region_id
und?
ok
i get
ok let me continue thx
bye
have you compiled the project?
i dont und ur english
it's present perfect tense
did you compile it?
u mean in site or here only?
of course here! how could it be in anoter way?
listen see what i did
its ok
but now wanna run in php
listen is it ok to do like this
type Ctrl + Alt + L on the seleciton, ok?
